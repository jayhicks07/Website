        <h2 class="border2">Titanfall 2 <div>Story</div>
        </h2>
        <h2 class="PARTY">SPOILER ALERT</h2>
        <p class="border">The story in this game is just phenomenal. The fact that you learn to be a pilot with Jack
            Cooper is just incredible. The game makes you feel for the characters. Sure Titanfall 2 might not have the
            most memorable, or best video game characters out there; but the fact that I started to care for BT and Jack
            says a lot about the way that this game's story works. Even just the fact that Titanfall 2 has a singal
            player campaing is just amazing because Titanfall 1 didn't have one of those. The campaign doesn't take very
            long to complete but you learn something new in each level.</p>
        <div>
            <h2 class="border2">Titanfall 2 <div>Multiplayer</div>
            </h2>
            <p class="border">The multiplayer in this game is better than the multiplayer in Titafall 1. The movement in
                Titanfall revoloutianized the FPS genre. Call of Duty even put some of the same movement techniques as
                their are in Titanfall series. Titanfall and Apex Legends were developed by Respawn Entertainment that
                was founded by the people that made Call of Duty when it was good, so MW 1 and 2.</p>
            <div>
                <h2 class="border2">Fortnite: Battle Royale</h2>
                <p class="border">This game revoloutianized the Battle Royale genre as it included building and editing
                    techniques. This is why the skill gap is so big in this game. Good players can build well, edit fast
                    and accurately, and aim close, medium and long range with all if not most range.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="border2">Minecraft</h2>
                <p class="border">This game is an absolute stunner in terms of video games. It really makes me reminis
                    every time I play or even just think about it. The game has had several updates and the newest
                    update to come out is 1.17, the Cave and Cliffs update. This might be the game changing update which
                    adds the aether and the warden and several new bosses.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="border2">Sea of Thieves</h2>
                <p class="border">This game is one that I've been playing scince day 1. I kid you not I woke up on the
                    day that it came out and the first thing that I did was buy Sea of Thieves. In my opinion, the fact
                    that Sea of Thieves has no story, that's what makes the game so good. It means that you can do
                    whatever you want and progress to Pirate Legend as fast or as slow as you want. If you want to learn
                    more about the game, go check out Zylbrad and watch his videos on the Sea of Thieves playlist.</p>

                <h2 class="border2">Rocket League</h2>
                <p class="border">This game is so much fun. I started playing in 2020, however I bought the game for
                    Â£7.99 off of the Xbox Store. I definitely have a lot of fun playing this. Harry and I have the world
                    record for the world's longest Private Match of Rocket League.</p>
